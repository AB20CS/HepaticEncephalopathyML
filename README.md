# Hepatic Encephalopathy Machine Learning Model
 
An ML model that may help predict the onset of [hepatic encephalopathy (HE)](https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(20)30466-9/fulltext). In short, HE is a neurological complication of cirrhosis.

Thus far, the Logistic Regression model providing the highest area under the curve (AUC) value. This is an ongoing project and I hope to improve this score as more data becomes available.
